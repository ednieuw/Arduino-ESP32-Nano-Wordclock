Serial communication with Serial terminal Termite

I use the simple Windows Serial terminal Termite beside the serial monitor in the IDE.
IDE 2 has the Serial terminal window at the bottom of the windows only showing a few lines at the cost of the programming area.
Therefore Termite is very handy to enter command and receive results in a separate window (Like in the IDE1)
With ESP-C3 and ESP-S3 MCU's one has to set

esp32s3.serial.disableDTR=false
esp32s3.serial.disableRTS=false

in boards.txt to TRUE to get Termite communication working.
